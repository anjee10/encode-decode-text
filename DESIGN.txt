### Design pattern

Simple controller / view design pattern is used in this code challange. This design pattern separates logic from view, making view components independent from the main business logic.

Requirement was less to satisfy Higher Order Component (HOC) design pattern which is perfect to reuse components.

Also true for Provider design pattern where you need to execute remote calls only once and where side effects are expesive, here it is not required.
